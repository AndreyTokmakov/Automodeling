1. Finish the Treatment Plan
  - add the remaining blocks

2. Move class Global from Tooth.cpp
  - think about how to issue it

3. You need to do a preprocessing of vtkPolyData teeth
  - should I store the original?
  - where to store the discharged data

4. Calculate the mesiodistal lengths of teeth

5. Contact points
  - Where to store

6. Add logging

7. Tooth readers/writers
  - Create separete module

8. Change:
        vtkSmartPointer<vtkObject> MyObject = vtkObject::New();
          --->
        vtkSmartPointer<vtkObject> MyObject = vtkSmartPointer<vtkObject>::New();
